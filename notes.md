### game design notes

* initial start of game feels good -> 3 active, rolling new mods is pretty frequent, upgrades and getting to first upgrade of +1 active mod feels smooth
* time from 1st additional active to 2nd additional active is also pretty timely
* but mods start to feel less useful, right around 1st/2nd upgrade need to increase mod rolls (eg. scale potential rolls by level somehow)
* general path might be -> first ~10 rolls really constrain values (eg. 50-150% gain, then open them up a bit more)
* rolling mods after a couple upgrades feels less useful, def need scaling modifiers here
